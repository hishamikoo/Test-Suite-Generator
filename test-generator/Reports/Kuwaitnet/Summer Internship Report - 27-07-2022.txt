Hisham Iqbal Khokhar

Objective - To build a web application that will allow admins to create a storage for test tasks and generate a test suite from them.

- Tested to see if the password field of the form works as expected. A few errors came by which were eventually fixed by modifiying the fields list in the meta class of 
  SuiteForm in forms.py.
- Modified the templates by adding background colors to the webpage and modifying the text font and alligning text in a proper way.
- Modified the Attachments model so that the file name and its contents can be rendered in the template.
- The attachments model and attachments field in task model are 2 different things as in the attachments model, the file is uploaded in FileField and in 
  the tasks model, the attachments field is a manytomany field. To read the contents of the file, the attachment in the FileField needs to opened as followed:
       
	 with open(self.file.path) as fp:
             return fp.read()
