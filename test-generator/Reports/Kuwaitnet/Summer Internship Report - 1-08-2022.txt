Hisham Iqbal Khokhar

Objective - To build a web application that will allow admins to create a storage for test tasks and generate a test suite from them.

- Used bootstrap documentation to update some features in the templates using html and css.
- Added new features in the buttons, tables and textareas.
- Added MEDIA_URL and MEDIA_ROOT in settings that take care of the attachments/files added in the admin page.
- Now, an attachment automatically gets added to a folder called "uploads" in the media folder.
- This is because of the "upload_to" argument used in FileFields which help uploading files in the specified folder. 
- This helped imporove sorting and management of files.
- Now, if an attachment is to be accessed in the app, the following url can be used:
   http://127.0.0.1:8000/media/<filename>

New Things in todays work:
- Media Folder (MEDIA_URL, MEDIA_ROOT)
- "upload_to" argument used in FileFields.
- Various other css and html features from bootstrap.
